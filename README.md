# Machine Learning projects using Python
 
Repository for all my python projects for ML Algorithm implementation

Adult Income Analysis:
* Objective: Testing out several different supervised learning algorithms over income data of subjects to find the one that accurately predicts if an individual makes more than $50,000,
* Usablity: This model will be helpful in many different ways by organizations who need to understand the income factor before choosing to analyse the candidates, such as Non-Profit organization for requesting for Donations or Banks to choose customers for their credit cards divisions.
* Datasource: UCI Machine Learning[http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income]

Sentiment Analysis and Recommender System of **Amazon** Reviews:
* Objective: The aim of this project is to assist in building Machine learning model to classify a review as “good” or “bad” based on the words used. Further, recommendation engine will help to make data based factual suggestions to customers on the e-commerce page, in order to make their buying experience easy and seamless. This project has been built keeping in mind the growing e-commerce industry market.
* Datasource: I have tried to used Amazon Dataset from http://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Amazon.html Or http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/ Amazon product data [Home and Kitchen dataset]
