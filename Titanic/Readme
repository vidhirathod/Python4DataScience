Titanic survival !

This is the legendary Titanic ML Dataset – the ideal dataset to dive into ML and familiarize yourself with ML Case Studies.

The data has been clean and split into two groups:

training set (train.csv):
The training set should be used to build your machine learning models. 
For the training set, we provide the outcome (also known as the “ground truth”) for each passenger. 
Model will be based on “features” like passengers’ gender and class. 

test set (test.csv):
The test set should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. 
For each passenger in the test set, use the model you trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.

The Problem Statement is simple: use machine learning to create an efficient Model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

Goal for this Notebook:
